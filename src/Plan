IDEA: static class input for input handling

Engine class does have a unique thread instance for each window -> each window instance need to have a thread example
So,
1. Recode window class to be easier and to have more flexibility. Status: OK
{
    Window class could be static? -> to think
    Window class interacts with user, but I need to control some Engine properties. How to do it? <- later
}
2. Recode renderer(or write new class of) in order to do simple things instead of more complex:
    renderer.render(List of models)[FUTURE: multiple lighting and mb different shading program]
3. Add texture support to model class(Mesh for now)
4. Learn how to do interacting between objects in more simple way
5.(->1) Engine
{
    What should engine do?
    to control window but.. mb Window should control Engine instance(Window should be static or no)
    let window class has an Engine instance where engine would do math for physics or smth.
}
